========

a simple Arduino sketch for monitoring my alarm and pool, and filling the pool when needed. events to be pushed, using UDP, into the renenw/h3 project.

the hardware is in place to manage gate access as well. this will require a second arduino, so, in due course, this code will need to be generalised to support multiple devices.
